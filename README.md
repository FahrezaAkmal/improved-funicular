# improved-funicular
This is my first time using GitHub, so maybe I will make a mistake because I don't really understand how to use GitHub, but I hope my knowledge is improved so that I can use GitHub smoothly. and I am also a new developer, still learning how to make websites, hopefully, I can still learn until I really understand.
